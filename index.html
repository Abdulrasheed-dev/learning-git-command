        I have an addiction. i cant help but view source on every nice looking website i see. it's 
        like if you had X-ray glasses that allow you to see any person you ever saw in their 
        underwear at will. How could you not? 
    </p>

    <p>
        It's just so tempting to see if a beautiful website is built with beautiful codes as well, or 
        if it's beauty if only skin-deep. Code? Beautiful? Sure. After al, Code is Art. This is just 
        HTML, so it cant be  quite as intricate and eligant as a dynamic language, but it's still bears 
        the brush strokes of it's creator and there is craftmanship abourd.
    </p>

    <p>
        It get me to thinking,what makes beautiful codes? <b>In HTML, it really comes down to craftmanshikoj</b>p. 
        It's all those little things added up that make the whole. Here is a list of just some of the 
        litttle things that i look for in others's code and that i try to do my self that make for good 
        craftmanship in HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    DOCTYPE Properly Decleared<br>
                </strong>
            </li>
                It looks like alot of gibbrish, but DOCTYPES are important. They not only allow your 
                code to validate, but they tell browsers things about how to render your pages. 
                Simple (htmt) tags don't cut it.
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Head Section.
                </strong> 
            </li>
                Tittle is set. Characters set decleared. stylesheet linked (including a print 
                stylesheet). Script liked and NOT include in full, external files have their own 
                related folders (eg. "css" and "script").
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                   Body  IDed 
                </strong> 
            </li>
                Putting an ID on your bodies allowed you to creat CSS properties that are unique 
                to the page. for instance, you may want your (h2) tags to look different on the 
                homepage. In your CSS you can write:#home h2{} to accomplish this and not affect (h2) 
                tags elseware.
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Clean Menu
                </strong> 
            </li>
            You've seen it before. You'll see it again. There is a reason on ordered list are used 
            for menu, because it reall gives you alot of control.
        </ul>
    </p>
